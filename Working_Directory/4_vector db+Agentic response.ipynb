Itchy skin is often caused by dry skin and is common in older adults, as skin tends to become drier with age. Depending on the cause of your itchiness, your skin may look no different than usual or it may be inflamed, rough or have bumps.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now know the final answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: The top diseases associated with itching, skin_rash, and nodal_skin_eruptions include eczema (atopic dermatitis), psoriasis, drug rashes, and other skin conditions such as dry skin (xerosis), scabies, and parasitic infections. Additionally, internal diseases like liver disease, kidney disease, anemia, diabetes, and thyroid problems can also cause itchy skin. However, it's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis requires a medical professional's evaluation, as the symptoms can be similar to many other conditions.\u001b[0m\n",
